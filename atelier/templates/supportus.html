    <h3> Support KDE Community </h3>
    <p>
      Atelier and AtCore are KDE Projects. And we believe on the vision of the community:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote">
      The KDEÂ® Community is a free software community dedicated to creating an open and user-friendly computing experience, offering an advanced graphical desktop, a wide variety of applications for communication, work, education and entertainment and a platform
      to easily build new applications upon. We have a strong focus on finding innovative solutions to old and new problems, creating a vibrant atmosphere open for experimentation.
